The dataset is available via this link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer. It contains patient information and labels that will be used to build the predictive models. You can follow alongside in the Jupyter Notebook as I guide you through each step of the process."

        "Now that our dataset is balanced, we can begin our trials. We will use cross-validation for each model to find the most optimal hyperparameters. We can evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as recall, accuracy, precision, f1 score, and a confusion matrix. Our main objective for all our models is to maximize recall, since it is more important we classify the amount of true positives as much as possible. This means we do not want patients with cancer to be falsely diagnosed as having no cancer."

The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closet datapoint from each class. The goal of the SVM is to maximize the margin as much as possible while keeping the number of misclassifications low. When the dataset is not linearly separable, the SVM uses a formula called the 'kernel trick' which projects data into a higher dimension."

        "Our Logistic Regression model was able to have a precision of 100% for class 1(cancer)! Our recall and f1 scores might not be as good as our previous models, but these insights could suggest building an ensemble model with Logistic Regression and the SVM or any of the other models to maximize both precision and recall in future works. The precision for class 0 was quite low with  score of 44%, suggesting again that our dataset is very imbalanced with more samples of the positive class than the negative class."

LGBM uses mainly decision trees as learners and splits each node leafwise as opposed to gradient-boosting levelwise splits. LGBM also differs from the traditional gradient boosting algorithm by using a gradient-based-one-side sampling(GOSS) technique, where it randomly samples data points with low gradient values with more emphasis on high gradient values."

        "The Categorical Boosting (Catboost)Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is another variant of the gradient-boosting algorithm.  The Catboost algorithm is optimized for categorical data as it uses decision trees as base learners to create different permutations of the dataset and then uses a technique called ordered target encoding. The algorithm also automatically creates new features by combining existing categorical features. These features are designed to capture interactions between categorical features, similar to interaction variables in multiple linear regression."

        "Our Catboost model does a good job of predicting cancer cases with a precision score of 99% and a recall score of 94%. The catboost model is also the most well-rounded for both classes boasting a recall score of 88% for class 0 (no cancer) and an f1 score of 74% for class 0. Our Catboost model also has the highest precision score for class 0 out of all our models, suggesting it does better at minimizing the number of false positives."

        "The Precision-Recall curve indicates that most of our models perform exceptionally well, with PR scores ranging from 98% to 100%. This aligns with the high precision and recall metrics, as these models are good at identifying class 1 (cancer cases).  A random chance baseline is included for context, emphasizing the imbalance of the dataset as it is at 90%. This means if a model were to guess class 1 randomly, it would have a 90% chance of being correct and would already achieve a high recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AUROC curve tells a different story. Here, the models struggle to balance the true positive and false positive rates, with scores ranging from 0.03 to 0.50. Even the best-performing SVM model achieves an AUROC score of only 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This indicates that most models face challenges in distinguishing class 0 (no cancer), likely due to the severe class imbalance. While techniques like SMOTE were applied to address this, further work is needed to explore alternative imbalance-handling strategies or feature engineering approaches.\n",

        "The primary objective of this project was to experiment with different models on a real-world problem and evaluate their performance and accuracy. A key challenge encountered was handling dataset imbalance, which is a common issue in real-world scenarios and requires algorithms capable of addressing such cases. While this project used a single method to tackle the imbalance, numerous alternative approaches could be explored in future work. Further efforts could focus on implementing and comparing different strategies to maximize recall for the positive class while maintaining optimal performance metrics for the negative class."
